  <p>
    For this homework we will be looking at the following problem: We are given a “k”-sorted collection of numbers. “K”-sorted in this problem is defined as every element within the array will be at most “k” positions away from its correct position.
  </p>

  <p>
    Example 1:
  </p>
  
  <pl-figure file-name="ex1.png" directory="clientFilesCourse"></pl-figure>

  <p>
    Notice in this example each element is at most two positions away from its correct spot and some elements are already in their correct spot (i.e. 2 and 6).
  </p>

  <p>
    Example 2:
  </p>

  <pl-figure file-name="ex2.png" directory="clientFilesCourse"></pl-figure>
  
  <p>
    Notice in this example each element is at most two positions away from its correct spot and some elements are already in their correct spot (i.e. 2).
